# InventoryApp
This was the final project in the Android Basics Nanodegree. 
We were asked to build an app to help track the sales and stock of particular inventory items. 
The project tested my ability to build a SQLite database, properly display the items in a ListView, 
handle intents to the phone's camera, and sanitizing user input.
